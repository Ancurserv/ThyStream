# Features:
* Optional Piracy - this feature allows users to choose their own streaming platform to use.

(By default anime shows/movies aren't available until you assign an anime streaming website to "url".


* Isolated space - each user gets a uniquely generated isolated server, this server is used for not only filtering out ads but also for allowing the users to be able to quickly navigate to their stream with no issues.
when a session ID is first generated for a user, the setup process (the loading activity) will begin to initiate the isolated server. This happens once per session ID generation since the servers are unique and therefore can't stay within the same session ID, once the session ID expires, the server also expires.

Each user gets a Session ID that lasts for 24 hours, the reason for the Session ID is so that users won't have to login/sign up, in order to invite your friends to your stream, just insert their Session ID, however in case you want to be in your streaming room by yourself then just insert your own session ID. Once the 24 hours is over then your session ID will expire and a new one will be generated for you.


* Command activation - Are you tired of having to click on a show and then click on the episode that you want to watch? Thystream will allow you to simply type in the show with the season and episode and it will start the video for you specifically for that season and episode. e.g.
"Attack on Titan season 2 episode 1"(you can also put s2 or ep1).)


# What makes Thystream a better choice for stream sharing?

1. You can start a stream by simply using your mobile device, a lot of other services e.g. Netflix, Kast won't allow you to setup a streaming room/party unless you have a PC, however that isn't the case for Thystream.

2. Thystream doesn't prioritize UI color schemes or any of that nonsense, I'm an experienced C/C++ developer so I could careless about UI design, Performance matters and Thystream does prioritize Speed and Security, it uses a particular algorithm for streaming video feed while consuming less data, it also alarms a person when someone else is buffering, so you won't have to worry about constantly asking someone "is it working for you", because if it stops working for them then it will stop working for you.
