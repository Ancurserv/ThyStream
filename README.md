# ThyStream
Thystream is an Android movie streaming Application meant for streaming movies between friends.

It's simple, straight-forward and functional. 

Opening the application will take you to an activity, on that activity you'll have a session ID generated for you(SI). this SI will be your temporal account ID(so you don't have to worry about making an account), after 24-hours. the Session ID will terminate itself and generate a new ID.
