# Features:
* Optional Piracy - this feature allows users to choose their own streaming platform to use.

(By default anime shows/movies aren't available until you assign an anime streaming website to "url".


* Isolated space - each user gets a uniquely generated isolated server, this server is used for not only filtering out ads but also for allowing the users to be able to quickly navigate to their stream with no issues.
when a session ID is first generated for a user, the setup process (the loading activity) will begin to initiate the isolated server. This happens once per session ID generation since the servers are unique and therefore can't stay within the same session ID, once the session ID expires, the server also expires.

Each user gets a Session ID that lasts for 24 hours, the reason for the Session ID is so that users won't have to login/sign up, in order to invite your friends to your stream, just insert their Session ID, however in case you want to be in your streaming room by yourself then just insert your own session ID. Once the 24 hours is over then your session ID will expire and a new one will be generated for you.


* Command activation - Are you tired of having to click on a show and then click on the episode that you want to watch? Thystream will allow you to simply type in the show with the season and episode and it will start the video for you specifically for that season and episode. e.g.
"Attack on Titan season 2 episode 1"(you can also put s2 or ep1).)


# What makes Thystream a better choice for stream sharing?

1. Streaming Portability

* Mobile users will be allowed to stream share, unlike other platforms e.g. Netflix, Kast where it's required to use a PC in order to initiate a streaming room/party, that won't be the case for Thystream.

2. Performance

* Thystream prioritizes both speed and security, users won't need to worry about networking issues within the application or security issues within the application.

# Security Concerns FAQ:

1. Wouldn't a person be able to inject malware since you allow people to use any website within the optional piracy feature?

No, any attempts of injecting malware will all be reflected, nothing is being broadcasted directly on your device so no one can infect your device, all packet injection attempts will also fail, the isolated servers aren't in relations to any core servers or user data, they aren't called isolated for no reason.

2. Do you collect user data?

No, once you install the application and open it, the session ID will be generated by itself, it doesn't rely on user data to remember which user is which or anything relating to that.

3. What if someone just modifies the application internally and manually replace their Session ID with mine?

Nothing would happen to you, all Session IDs are unique and cannot be recreated.
